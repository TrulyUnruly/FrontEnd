    <main>
        <p>The Body Condition Score (BCS) is a quantitative method for evaluating
                body fat. Think of it as the animal equivalent of the Body Mass Index (BMI) for humans.
                The BCS is a tool used for measuring the ideal weight of our pets. Almost 60% of domestic 
                cats are considered overweight! Read on to learn more about the BCS and how you can use it 
                to determine the condition of your cat.

        <h2>Types of Body Condition Scores for Cats</h2> 
        <p>There are two recognized BCS scales: one ranging from one to nine 
            and the other from one to five. Both scales operate on the same principle.
            The ideal weight is given in the middle, so 4 and 5 on the nine-point scale
            or 3 on the five-point scale. Cats scoring below (one or two on the five-point scale
            or one, two or three on the nine-point scale) are considered underweight. 
            Cats with values above the ideal weight (four or five on the five-point scale
            or six, seven, eight or nine on the nine-point scale) carry excess weight.

                    viewed from the side. Fat can be felt around ribs, spine and hip bones.
