        <p>Routine body condition assessments are essential for monitoring your cat's
            health and managing weight-related issues. A hands-on evaluation can help
            determine where your cat falls on the 1-9 Body Condition Score (BCS) scale
            and guide appropriate care.
        </p>
       
    <ol>
    <h3><li>Ensure the Cat is Comfortable and Calm</h3>
            Begin by placing your cat in a quiet, familiar environment. The cat may be standing, sitting
            or lying down naturally - the assessment can be adapted based on your cat's preferred position.
            Use gentle, soothing touches while palpating key areas, and provide plenty of reassurance throughout
            the process to keep the cat relaxed and comfortable.
        </li> 
    <h3><li>Assess the Ribs</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Gently run your fingers along the ribcage, starting just behind the front legs.</li>
        <li>In a cat with an ideal BSC, the ribs should be easily felt but not visible, with a thin layer of 
            fat covering them.</li>
        <li>If ribs feel sharp or very prominent, your cat may be underweight.</li>
        <li>If the ribs are difficult to feel or buried under fat, your cat may be overweight or have obesity.</li>
        </ul>
        </li> 
    <h3><li>Check for Fat Deposits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While examining the ribs, note any excess fat accumulation in common areas
            such as the chest, abdomen and base of the tail. Localized fat pads can be an
            arly indicator of unhealthy weight gain.</li>
    </ul>
    </li> 
    <h3><li>Examine the Spine and Back</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Gently run your hands along the spine from the shoulders to the hips.</li>
        <li>You should feel defined vertebrae, but they should not feel overly sharp.</li>
        <li>A prominent spine suggests underweight; a spine padded with fat may indicate
            overweight or obesity. In underweight cats, the spine will feel prominent
            and sharp, while in overweight cats, it will be padded or hard to feel.</li>
    </ul>
    </li> 
    <h3><li>Feel Hips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Palpate the hips and surrounding muscle.</li>
        <li>In a cat with healthy body condition, the hip bones are detectable but not protruding.
            In an underweight cat, the hips will feel bony and lack softness. In an overweight cat,
            the hips will be padded or difficult to feel due to fat deposits.</li>
        <li>Bony, sharp hips = underweight.</li>   
        <li>Rounded, hard to feel hips = overweight or obese.</li>
    </ul>
    </li> 
    <h3><li>Evaluate the Abdomen and Primordial Pouch (Side View)</h3>
            Gently feel the Abdomen and observe the side profile.
    <ul>
        <li>An ideal body condition will show a gradual upward slope from the ribcage to the hind legs (abdominal tuck).</li>
        <li>The primordial pouch, a loose, swinging flap along the abdomen, is normal and not necessarily a sign of excess fat.</li>
        <li>Severe tuck = underweight</li>
        <li>No tuck, sagging or bulging belly = overweight or obesity.</li>
    </ul>
    </li> 
    <h3><li>Look for a Waist (Top View)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View the cat from above and check for a waistline behind the ribs.</li>
        <li>An ideal body condition has a slight taper towards the hips.</li>
        <li>A very narrow waist may suggest underweight</li>
        <li>A broad, rounded body shape with no visible waist indicates overweight or obesity.</li>
    </ul>
    </li> 
    </ol>
